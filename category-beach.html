			    <p>Ocean Beach is a beach that runs along the west coast of San Francisco, California, United States, at the Pacific Ocean. It is adjacent to Golden Gate Park, the Richmond District, and the Sunset District. The Great Highway runs alongside the beach, and the Cliff House and the site of the former Sutro Baths sit at the northern end. The beach is a part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which is administered by the National Park Service.

During the late spring and summer, San Francisco's characteristic foggy weather frequently envelops the beach. The average temperature for last 5 years has been 55.8 °F .However, the beach is popular with surfers and participants in bonfire parties.[citation needed] More beach-friendly weather occurs in late fall and early spring, when fog is less prevalent.

The water at Ocean Beach is noteworthy for its strong currents and waves, which makes it popular among serious surfers. The water is cold, due in part to a process known as upwelling, in which frigid water from below the ocean surface rises to replace the surface water that moves away from the beach as a result of the Coriolis effect. The rapid rip currents and cold water make the ocean dangerous for casual swimmers and even those who simply want to set foot in it, and swimmers have been swept away and drowned. Nevertheless, the beach is one of the Bay Area's top surfingspots. The southern portion of the beach by Sloat Boulevard is one of the cleanest in the state

			    <p>Surf is an unincorporated community in Santa Barbara County, California. It lies on the Pacific coast on Vandenberg Air Force Base west of the city of Lompoc. The community is the site of Surf Beachand the Surf Amtrak Station. California State Route 246 use to run to Surf, but in 1984 the highway was truncated at Lompoc; the road from Lompoc to Surf is now West Ocean Avenue.

Surf grew as a railway town after Southern Pacific Railroad built a station here for its Coast Line in 1900. In 1909, the schooner cargo ship Sibyl Marston sank off the coast south from Surf.The station at Surf became popular with U.S. Army soldiers stationed at Camp Cooke (now Vandenberg Air Force Base) during World War II. The population of the town peaked at 40, with most residents being employed with the railroad. As trains modernized, Surf experienced depopulation, to the point where Southern Pacific was only operating a telegraph station. The telegraph station closed in 1985, and it was not until 2000 that the current Surf Amtrak Station was completed. The unstaffed Amtrak station is currently the only structure left standing in Surf.

Sections of Surf Beach are closed between March 1 and September 30 every year during the nesting season of the western snowy plover. The closures are in place to protect the bird under theEndangered Species Act. If a set number of trespass violations have been reached during any nesting season (currently 50), the beach is closed entirely.

Two fatal shark attacks have occurred near Surf Beach: one on October 22, 2010, and the other on October 23, 2012. Travel + Leisure has listed it as one of the worst beaches for shark attacks.</p>
